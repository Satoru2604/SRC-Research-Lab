PRE-PUBLICATION SECURITY AUDIT
================================================================================

Date: 2025-10-16
Purpose: Security scrub before public arXiv/GitHub publication

================================================================================
1. SECRETS & SENSITIVE PATHS SCRUB
================================================================================

Search Pattern: PASSWORD|API_KEY|SECRET|/home/|/mnt/data|src_engine_private
Search Scope: src-research-lab/ directory only

Results:
✓ NO passwords, API keys, or secrets found in public research lab
✓ Absolute paths removed from results/*.manifest.json files
✓ References to src_engine_private are:
   - In comments/documentation (explaining closed-core architecture)
   - In path references (../src_engine_private/) that users replace locally
   - NOT exposing any proprietary code or binaries

Action: PASS - No sensitive data in public repository

================================================================================
2. LICENSING CONFIRMATION
================================================================================

Current License: MIT License
Location: LICENSE.md (root), README.md header

Verification:
✓ MIT license file present and complete
✓ All code files can be released under MIT
✓ Dataset files are synthetic/generated (no licensing conflicts)
✓ Mock bridge is MIT-compatible
✓ No third-party proprietary dependencies

Action: PASS - MIT license is appropriate and complete

================================================================================
3. MOCK VS REAL ENGINE LABELING
================================================================================

Current Documentation:
✓ README.md clearly states "closed-core, open science" architecture
✓ Each public benchmark bundle includes mock_bridge.py
✓ Bundle READMEs explain mock limitations

Enhancements Needed:
→ Add explicit section in release/public_benchmarks/README.md
→ Add mock vs real comparison notes to paper
→ Include disclaimer in arXiv ancillary files

Action: NEEDS ENHANCEMENT (will complete below)

================================================================================
4. PROVENANCE & REPRODUCIBILITY
================================================================================

Existing Artifacts:
✓ release/H4_FINAL_AUDIT.json (comprehensive validation)
✓ release/PHASE_H4_FINAL_SIGNOFF.txt (formal approval)
✓ release/archived_checksums/ (31 files verified)
✓ leaderboard/reports/*.json (7 submission reports)
✓ reports/*.log (validation and verification logs)

Paper Requirements:
✓ Reproducibility appendix exists in paper skeleton
✓ Links to validation reports included
✓ Exact commands documented in bundle READMEs

Action: PASS - Comprehensive provenance established

================================================================================
5. ETHICS & PRIVACY
================================================================================

Dataset Review:
✓ All datasets are synthetic or open-source
✓ NO personally identifiable information (PII)
✓ NO proprietary third-party data
✓ Gradient datasets: synthetic (numpy.random with fixed seed=42)
✓ Text datasets: Lorem ipsum / public domain samples
✓ Image datasets: random binary data

Closed-Core Ethics:
✓ Explicit documentation of offline/no-telemetry design
✓ Clear separation of public research and private engine
✓ Mock bridge enables external validation without core exposure

Action: PASS - Add ethics section to paper (will complete)

================================================================================
6. FINAL SMOKE TEST STATUS
================================================================================

Test Plan:
1. Run pytest (all 99 tests)
2. Execute each public benchmark bundle
3. Verify checksums
4. Compile paper to PDF

Action: WILL EXECUTE (next steps below)

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

Security Status: ✓ PASS
Licensing Status: ✓ PASS  
Labeling Status: → NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
Provenance Status: ✓ PASS
Ethics Status: → NEEDS ETHICS SECTION
Smoke Test Status: → PENDING EXECUTION

Overall Assessment: READY FOR PUBLICATION after completing:
1. Enhanced mock vs real engine documentation
2. Ethics & privacy section in paper
3. Final smoke tests
4. arXiv package creation
