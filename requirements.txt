# Bridge SDK Requirements (Phase H.1)
#
# Python dependencies for the SRC Research Lab Bridge SDK.
# All dependencies are standard or widely-available packages.

# Manifest parsing

# for core functionality (subprocess, pathlib, json, time, signal)

# System requirements (not installed via pip):
# - Python 3.8+
# - zstd (command-line tool)
# - lz4 (command-line tool)
# - src-engine binary (proprietary, at ../src_engine_private/)
