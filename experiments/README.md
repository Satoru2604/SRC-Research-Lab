# Experiments

This directory contains experiment definitions, runners, and configuration files.

Guidelines:

- Use the experiment runner located in `metrics/` for CAQ computations.
- All experiments are CPU-first by default.
- Each experiment should include a `README.md` describing reproducible steps.
