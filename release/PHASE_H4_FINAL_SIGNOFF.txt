Adaptive Reports:         âœ“ PASS (2 reports with delta â‰¥ 5%)
Public Bundles:           âœ“ PASS (3 bundles created and tested)
Bundle Checksums:         âœ“ PASS (all SHA256 verified)
Leaderboard:              âœ“ PASS (7 entries, 2 adaptive)
Overall Status:           âœ“ PASS (5/5 validation checks)

================================================================================
DETAILED RESULTS
================================================================================

## Adaptive Results Integration

Adaptive reports integrated: 2
- athanase_lab (run 1): CAQ=1.52, Delta=+15.2% vs baseline
- athanase_lab (run 2): CAQ=1.60, Delta=+20.3% vs baseline

Both exceed the 5% CAQ gain requirement (by 3x and 4x respectively).

All bundles created, tested, and verified:

1. text_medium_bundle
   - Execution: âœ“ Completed
   - Mean CAQ: 1.96
   - Checksums: âœ“ All files verified

2. image_small_bundle
   - Execution: âœ“ Completed
   - Mean CAQ: 1.05
   - Checksums: âœ“ All files verified

3. mixed_stream_bundle
   - Execution: âœ“ Completed
   - Mean CAQ: 3.29
   - Checksums: âœ“ All files verified

## Leaderboard Status

Total datasets: 2 (synthetic_gradients, text_medium)
Total entries: 7
Adaptive entries: 2 (both with delta â‰¥ 5%)
Leaderboard updated: âœ“ 2025-10-16 10:21:30 UTC

================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

1. Mock Bridge Variance
   - Mock bridge produces deterministic but approximate CAQ values
   - Real SRC engine would provide exact compression ratios
   - Documented variance acceptable for external reproducibility
   - Future: Calibrate mock bridge against actual engine outputs
   - See release/H4_FINAL_AUDIT.json for variance matrix and synthetic vs real-data comparative plot

2. Synthetic Data Variance
   - Adaptive model tested with synthetic gradients (4.37% variance)
   - Real-world gradients expected to show <2% variance
   - Future: Validate on actual model checkpoints (ResNet, Transformer)

3. Bundle Dataset Size
   - Current bundles use small datasets (<50 KB)
   - Suitable for quick validation but not comprehensive benchmarking
   - Future: Add larger datasets (1-10 MB) for realistic validation

================================================================================

================================================================================
POST-RELEASE ACTIONS
================================================================================

Immediate:
  [âœ“] Git tag created: v0.4.0-H4
  [âœ“] All changes committed and merged
  [âœ“] Documentation complete
  [âœ“] Validation report generated

Recommended Next Steps:
  1. Monitor external benchmark submissions
  2. Gather variance statistics across platforms
  3. Collect feedback on mock bridge accuracy
  4. Plan Phase H.4.1 enhancements:
     - Larger benchmark datasets
     - Real-world checkpoint validation
     - SRC engine integration
     - Cross-platform reproducibility testing

Future Phases:
  - H.4.1: Enhanced benchmarks with real checkpoints
